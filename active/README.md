This directory contains the source code and data files for running SPOM experiments with the active dispersal modes.

Files containing '_a' in the basename are part of the simulations with active (without gap-avoidance) dispersal:

    com_D_a.csv
    com_G_a.csv
    com_I_a.csv
    esim_a_1.sh
    tsim_a_iA_1.sh

Files containing '_i' are part of the simulations with active WITH gap-avoidance dispersal (aka iterative dispersal):

    com_D_i.csv
    com_G_i.csv
    com_I_i.csv
    esim_i_1.sh
    tsim_i_iA_1.sh
