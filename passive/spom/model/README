The following libraries are required by the C module:
  - FFTW3
  - SWIG2
  - Gnu Scientific Library

The Python module requires:
  - numpy

The fast SIMD Mersenne Twister random number generation
library is included in the directory src/dSFMT.

How to build:

1) If not already installed, compile FFTW3 with threads and PIC enabled:
    ./configure --enable-threads --enable-shared --with-pic
    make && make install

2) If necessary, edit the Makefile and set the correct paths:
   - PYTHON_INCLUDES should point to python header directory (e.g. -I/usr/include/python2.7)
   - NUMPY_INCLUDES should point to numpy header file directory 
   - FFTW_LIB_PATH should point to the linkable FFTW library files

3) Run make.
